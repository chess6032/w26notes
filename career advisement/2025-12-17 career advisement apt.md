- Wagner knows many people from math, physics, etc. etc. who later down the line became software engineers.

FOR NEXT TIME: Grab 2 blocks (full hr) w/ Wagner, and we'll make the Red Thread docs (see below).

# RED THREAD (for next time)

(Name comes from Greek mythology)

## IDEA

### Reference Document

Once you've decided on/defined a career direction/objective (e.g. full-stack dev, back-end guy, game dev, AI, etc.), create a reference document about the foundational skills that makes that you a good professional in that field today. 

### Gap Analysis Document

Then, we'll assess the gap between the skills you have and the skills in your reference document; i.e. it lists all the skills you need to work on and learn.

### Career Plan Document

A list of resources to acquire the skills and close the gab 

- Classes
- Projs
- On-campus opportunities (TAs, RAs, Labs, etc.)
- Off-campus opportunities (internships, etc.)

# Making a decision on career

Three main things you have to consider (drew a venn diagram):

1. Do you love it? i.e. Do you like doing that work? (NOT "passion". You're career doesn't HAVE to be your passion, it can just be your career. It can just be the means to provide for your family, the means through which you express yourself, etc. Wagner says that turning a passion into a career often ruins it.)
2. Are you good at it? When you find a challenge or situation, do you feel confident that you can figure it out? 
3. MONEY! There has to have enough market today and for the next at least 10 yrs for your to provide for yourself/your family.

The sweetspot is in the middle.

Only Love + Good = Broke.
Only Love + Money = Incompetent. (You'll lose your job.)
Only Good + Money = Miserable.


Then, if you're a member of the church, there's two more things you'd want out of a job.

- Meaning
	- We are given talents from HF. Our career can be a way to magnify and express those talents. Do you feel you will be able to increase or multiply some of the talents you have received from God? 
- (Spiritual) Satisfaction
	- One of the objectives of labor, the scriptures talk about, is to provide you with satisfaction. Wagner said when he leaves his job, he is physically exhausted, but spiritually enlarged, fed, etc.

## For next time

Come with a main career objective, and 2-3 back-ups.

Do research: Ask 

Pray about it as well. 

When Wagner prayed about which career to take, HF answered: "It doesn't matter. Pick one, and I'll help you. What I care about is that you are a good man."

## Where to find jobs/job titles

It's hard bc you have to know some semblance of knowledge of the field you're interested in to be able to look up stuff about it.

1. Start w/ AI: "What are some of the roles today for computer graphics/game dev/etc. etc." Ask about the market, open positions, etc. Ask for links. Ask what things employers are asking for. 
2. Look up one of those roles on LinkedIn, Indeed, job portals, etc. to see what those roles look like at a company and what they're asking for.



METHOD FOR SOLVING INDECISION: Pick something and just walk towards it. That will give you momentum enough that you get unstuck.
