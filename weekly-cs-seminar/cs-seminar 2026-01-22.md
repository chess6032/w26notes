CS Seminar  
Dr. Christian J. Weibell  
From "You" to "Crew": The Changing Role of Software Engineer in a Post-IC World


---

We started off w/ the Mr. Terrific Fight Scene from Superman (2025). Dope.

He then proceeded to explain to us at length Mr. Terrific's abilities & skills: No innate superpowers, just genius.

# Speaker: Dr. Weibell

- Graduated from BYU w/ Bachelors in CS 


# For today

*Ew AI art. Remember when we used to populate our PowerPoint w/ images from Google images&mdash;sometimes not even bothering to find one without a watermark.*

GOAL: Help you **think boradly** about the **range of opportunities** that open up w/ a CS education, and what i can look like to use CS over a career.

# We live in a Post-IC World

"IC" means "individual contributor".

## Dr. Weibell's history

- pre-1997: Used Perl to scrape websites, pick up FTP drops, connect to DBs, and pull out all this data from nat labs across the US to find labs w/ excess materials that they could nab. 
    - Got really good w/ Perl. When he came back to school, he worked in IT doing Flash development (course developments & stuff), and in that job someone was like, "Hey you know Perl? My brother needs someone who knows Perl. He's making this thing called 'WebStat'".
- 1997: WebSTAT.
    - Basically a one-man show.
    - Coded into the early morning (Like 4-6 AM lol) and then wake up @ 9:00 for school.
    - Recruited folks to his team.
        - Hired two BYU students: One from Nepal, the other from India. (He's still friends w/ the guy from Nepal today.)
- 2002: Microsof made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
    - Part of the MS Office Team.
    - He got that offer not only because he could write his own code but bc he could do the business side a little, too.
- Came back to BYU and got his PhD.
- 2011: Got recruited by NitroSecurity&mdash;a company his father-in-law started.
    - Started w/ a (horribly designed) DOS-based Windows program and brought it to Web.
    - *(You can tell he loved his job.)*
    - NitroSecurity ended up getting bought by McAfee.
- 2015: Personalized learning @ Agilix Labs.
    - "Traditional LLMS platform"
    - Very passionate ab this.
    - (*Bro is just advertising himself at this point.*)
    - After not too long, he became a guy flying out and consulting folks how to implement Agilix into their technology system or smth idrk tbh. 
- 2015-2020: Recruited back by the same group that got sold to McAfee.
    - This time, they had money, so they could use AI. 
        - Paid $1mil/year. 
    - Showed us a dashboard of the software for data loss prevention.
    - Uhhhh it looks like the app might be called "Digital Guardian"? 
    - Loved HCI. (HCI was one of his emphases when he was here.)
    - Used whiteboards a LOT.
        - Skimmed all four walls in his office so he could write on them as whiteboards. (That's kinda rizz ngl.)
        - Had tons of details/slides explaining his whiteboard prototyping/thinking process for this one product. He had to skim through it tho. 
- 2020-2024: An AI company. (ELB Learning, I think?)
    - Work he did there was a lot higher level. 
        - Spent a lot less time writing code (although he still did stuff like code reviews).
        - Business + Technical
    - Drove an initiative he called the "Blue Lightning Vision"&mdash;a shared technology strategy vision.
        - This highlights how he still drawing deeply on his CS background, but applying it in a very business-y way.
- Professional side hobby: Excavator Guy
    - Showed us a video about Australian Bauxite Mining (by @buildwitt on YouTube). *(Dude it looked like hecking Dune.)*
    - ^ Weibell worked w/ him to make some BuildWitt product.
    - By this point, he uses AI all the time in his development.

Dr. Weibell went through all this to highlight all the varied types of problem solving & role types you might do in a software engineering.

- So in the early years of your career, you'll spend a lot of time writing code. But as you move up in your career, you'll get more and more high level. 
    - Your influence will grow broader, but you'll still be utilizing/relying on your technical depth.


## Using AI in software development

- Fully embraced using Cursor for development.
    - Using it w/ a Mono Repo that has 12 sub-projects. (i.e. GIANT CODEBASE)

### Onboarding

- "Provide a one-page onboarding page for this code base".
    - 15 seconds to make a 2 minute read page.
    - ^ Compare a new developer reading that to going through tons and tons of documentation and stuff.

### Bug Investigation

- A UI thing broke. He took a screenshot of the UI and asked Cursor for help. Corsor found the problem in 11 seconds.
    - OK I can't lie that's kinda huge.

### Tribal, Domain, and System knowledge

- That's smth you usually only pick up when you've been around at the company/team/product for a long time.
- ^ But AI knows immediately.

### DevOps

- "DevOps" = managing deployments.
- (He uses "Azure DevOps".)
- In 8 secs, AI was able to give him a breakdown of all his pipelines. (And recommendations for how to modify it.)
    - Said he no longer need to pay an engineer $130K... Uhhh... that's certainly something tell a bunch of undergrads...

### NOT vibe coding

Weibell emphasized that he was not just vibe coding. He was using AI in a disciplined way. 

E.g., before jumping into the product's code to do stuff, he would ask Cursor to write scripts that could diagnose stuff he needs to see.

KEY TAKEAWAY: **The way to be successful w/ AI is to apply the same principles you've learned as a software engineer.** (Work incrementally, manage your risks, etc.)

He treats AI like a team member, he said. He holds it accountable the same way. 

### Uhhhh, sir, this isn't very inspiring

Weibell said his company's currently working on rewriting their entire back-end architecture. 

He has one guy doing that.

What took 9 months & 5 people in the past now took 3 weeks & 1 person.

(Bro really just came in here and trolled us talking ab how jobs are getting erased.)

# FAQ

## Technical Death? 

Someone asked if he's worried about nobody understanding the code, because it's all written by AI. 

Weibell said he used to. (He used to never use AI-written code he didn't understand). But now he doesn't.

Uhhhh...

## Jobs?

Jobs right now are falling away. But, after a bit of time, Weibell says, demand will increase due to new opportunities bc of the increased productivity AI provides.

## Starting out fresh w/ AI vs. managing an existing code base w/ AI

One student said it feels like AI is more effective when you have an existing code base, compared to if you're starting from the ground up. He asked if Weibell finds if there's a difference based on how much existing code there is.

Weibell's used AI for both. He said it's all about available context: For existing code bases, that context is the code; for new code, you'll have to provide that context someplace else.

## Open source options for AI-driven development?

A lot of AI is free to use.

Talked ab the difference btwn open-sourced models and **open-weight** models.

## Limitations?

uhhh I wasn't paying attention.

## Where are we at in terms of using AI for mission-critical code?

AI is not deterministic. So any time you deploy smth w/ AI-written code, you have to be extra careful.

Weibell compared the emergence of AI to the emergence of the web. He told the story of how when BYU first opened a network, the security was non-existent&mdash;you could look at everyone else's files (or smth like that I didn't super understand the technical details).
