DAY TWO: Setting up the dev environment  

---

Ummmm so I came so late that there were only 15 mins left of class :/

# Terminal

Jensen recommends using a terminal program called Warp. It's a little bit nicer than the default terminal. Plus on Windows it gives you access to bash commands. And also it has AI built in, so if you want to kill the environment it's perfect for you.

# Tech stack

A "tech stack" is the technology used to make an app work.  

```
REACT               front-end
                        ^
Caddy 2                 |
                        |
Node JS                 |
                        v
mongoDB             back-end
```
